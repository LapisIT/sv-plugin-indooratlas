# sv-plugin-indooratlas

An experimental cordova plugin for IndoorAtlas SDK 2.1.2. (https://www.indooratlas.com/)

* Android only - version 5.0.0
* Get current location (timer based, no error handling)
* API key must be provided in AndroidManifest.xml
* SDK repo: http://indooratlas-ltd.bintray.com/mvn-public/

Please note this is not a production ready, needs to refine it if you want to use it for a production. (
IndoorAtlas is apparently releasing the cordova plugin soon.)
